I am adding the link in the readme file since my Model - best_fire_detection_model.pkl file is 439.4 MB. Any file larger than 25 MB is not accepted in the Github without LFS. Students, you can also share the link in the github just like I did. If you don't know how to create the readme file, you can download my readme file and edit it.

Link for the Model: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w2fvB54FvNihaIXJABpRGmffVX5vYCH0?usp=sharing
